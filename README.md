## üåü Features

### Homepage
The homepage serves as the central hub where users can view and interact with the most important aspects of their shifts:

- **Monthly Target:** Users can set a monthly earnings target during registration. The homepage compares this target with the net earnings accumulated based on hours worked and the hourly rate provided during clock-in.

- **Clock-In/Clock-Out Buttons:** Users can clock in and out of their shifts using dedicated buttons. Upon clicking, a form appears allowing users to enter details such as:
  - Organization name
  - Hourly rate
  - Shift type (Normal, Overtime)
  - Submit button to save the data in the database

- **Shift List:** Displays a list of all shifts worked, including details such as organization, hours worked, and earnings for the day. Each entry also includes a delete button to remove incorrect or unnecessary data.

- **Total Hours:** Shows the cumulative total hours worked for the current month. This resets at the start of a new month.

- **Earnings Calculation:**
  - **Earnings + Tax:** Displays total earnings including tax for the current month.
  - **Earnings - Tax/NI:** Displays net earnings after deducting tax and National Insurance (NI) contributions. Calculations are updated in real-time as users clock in and out.
  
- **PDF Export:** Users can download and share their clock-in list as a PDF, useful for resolving any disputes.

### Shift Booking Manager
The Shift Booking Manager helps users organize their shifts visually using a calendar interface:

- **Calendar View:** Displays monthly dates, with booked shifts highlighted in red and the current day in green.

- **Shift Booking:** Users can book a shift by selecting a day on the calendar and entering shift details. The selected date turns red, indicating a booked shift.

- **Email Notifications:** Users receive an email notification four hours before the start of any booked shift.

- **Shift List:** A list of all booked shifts is displayed below the calendar. Users can delete shifts if canceled. At the end of each month, all shifts are automatically deleted to prepare the calendar for new bookings.

### To-Do Application
The built-in To-Do application helps users manage tasks:

- **Task Management:** Users can add tasks with a name and description. Tasks can be deleted once completed.

- **Task List:** Displays all submitted tasks in a list format, giving users an overview of their pending activities.

### Navigation Links
The application includes a navigation bar with the following links:

- **Homepage:** Navigate back to the main dashboard.
- **Shift Booking Manager:** Access the shift booking calendar.
- **To-Do Application:** Manage your tasks.
- **Sign Out:** Log out of the application.
- **Video Tutorials:** Access video tutorials on how to use the application effectively.
